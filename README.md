# Game Jam Quick-Start Kit

This is just a minimal quick-start boilerplate repo intended for personal use in game jams.

Functionality includes:
 > Simple Asset preloader
 > Included bitmap font and basic function to draw text with it
 > Several utility functions for drawing
 > Automatic canvas sizing/positioning
 > Simple Update/Render gameloop with timing
 > Enough comments to get acquainted with the project

Depends on TypeScript and Webpack.

To use the project, clone the repo and run `npm install` within the project directory.
When that's done, do `npm run watch`. 

I recommend browser-sync for a less tedious development experience.
Run it as a server in the _dist_ directory.
